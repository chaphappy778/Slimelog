# SlimeLog — Error Tracker

Living log of bugs, gotchas, and their fixes. Keep entries dated. Newest at
top. When a class of error keeps recurring, note the pattern so future-us
recognizes it faster.

Categories used below (pick one per entry):

- **Auth** — sign in / sign up / recovery / session state
- **DB** — schema, RLS, triggers, CHECK constraints, migrations
- **UI** — rendering, layout, stacking contexts, hydration
- **Perf** — slow queries, wasteful renders, oversized bundles
- **Ingest** — brand claims, brand ingestion, image uploads
- **Stripe** — subscriptions, webhooks, tier sync
- **Ops** — deploys, env config, third-party outages
- **CORS / External** — anything cross-origin or cross-service

## Known potential issues (not-yet-hit, worth watching)

### 2026-07-11 — Brand logo CORS on GalaxyView hubs (CORS / External)

**Symptom (if it hits):** brand logo images fail to render in `/collection`
Galaxy view; hub falls back to color puck silently. `<canvas>` may also
throw a security error if we later try to read pixels back.

**Root cause:** GalaxyView loads brand logos into `<img>` via
`crossOrigin="anonymous"` and paints them into a canvas. If Supabase
Storage isn't returning `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` for our web origin,
or if a brand's `logo_url` points to an external CDN that doesn't allow
CORS, the image won't paint. This is a passive issue: nothing breaks
today, but it caps how rich the galaxies can get.

**Prevention / fix path:**

1. Serve all brand logos from Supabase Storage (already the plan). Confirm
   the `brand-logos` bucket is public and has permissive CORS headers.
2. When we add a brand-claim upload flow, always pipe uploads through our
   own bucket; never store an external `logo_url` verbatim.
3. If we ever want to snapshot the galaxy to PNG for share cards, the
   canvas will be tainted the moment a non-CORS image lands. Snapshot
   would need to run server-side or refetch images with a proxy.

**Regression check:** open `/collection` on a browser DevTools Network tab.
Logo requests should be `status 200` with `access-control-allow-origin`
header matching our web origin. Failed CORS logs a warning in console
but is otherwise silent.
